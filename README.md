Note, that this was a project made for fun and for educational purposes.
I do not plan on continuing this in the near future or do some somewhat needed code clean-up and refactoring.

Controls can be changed in the controller object under controls (line 242+) or optionally, you can use the standard controls:


a =  move left

d = move right


arr_left = counter clockwise rotation

arr_right = clockwise rotation

arr_up or down = 180 turn (flip)


s = soft drop

space = hard drop / start / reset if game over


shift = hold


esc / p = pause (only works if not timed)

backspace = reset mid-game


tab = switching between timed and casual (just look at the timer to see which one you're on)


((don't trust the buttons on the right, they're evil))
